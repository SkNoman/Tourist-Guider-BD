<h1><u>Setup Guide</u></h1>
The API Services this application using from this repository: <b>https://github.com/SkNoman/CRUD-API-NODE-JS.git.</b>
Which is running on my local machine so none these api will not work in your device.

<b>Solution:</b>
1. Clone and run api project in your device link: https://github.com/SkNoman/CRUD-API-NODE-JS.git
2. Then you need change BASE URL (base_url) from android project you have to define in your local.properties file
3. Now you are good to go with application

Notes: Make sure your API project and ANDROID test device is running under same network/WI-FI,
otherwise you will not be able to access data through API.

<b>Instead you can use your own API if you have any</b>
